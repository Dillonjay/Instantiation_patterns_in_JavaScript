### Functional. 
Functional instantiation is a straignt forward way to attach methods to a constructor function. 
You define a method inside of the constructor function and create a new instance of that method every single time the constructor is called. 

### Pros.
Easy to follow and implement.

### Cons.
Uses more memory. Every time the constructor function is called, a brand new instance of every method is created again.
